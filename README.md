# 🔐 Password Strength Analyzer & Custom Wordlist Generator

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **cybersecurity tool** that combines two main functionalities:
1. **Password Analyzer** – Evaluates password strength using entropy calculations and the `zxcvbn` library.  
2. **Wordlist Generator** – Builds custom wordlists from user-provided hints (like names, dates, or nicknames) with transformations such as leetspeak, case changes, year appending, and more.  

The tool is designed for **educational and ethical use only** – helping users understand weak password patterns and assisting security researchers in training or penetration testing.

- Entropy calculation for mathematical unpredictability.
- Custom wordlist generation from user hints.
- Transformations applied:  
  - ✅ Case variations  
  - ✅ Leetspeak substitutions  
  - ✅ Prefixes & suffixes  
  - ✅ Reverse strings  
  - ✅ Year-based appends  
- Export generated wordlists in `.txt` format.
- Available in both **CLI** and **Web/GUI** versions.
